## Project Description
The E-commerce Sales Data Analysis Project explores the sales performance of an online retail business. The project utilizes an extensive sales dataset, covering various aspects such as products, customers, transactions, and regional data. Key components of the project include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, predictive modeling, and creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to present the findings and insights effectively.

## Objectives

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Address missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies. Convert data types and format dates to ensure readiness for analysis and modeling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset’s structure and characteristics. Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in the data Analyze customer behavior and product performance.
- Data Visualization and Power BI Dashboard: Create meaningful visualizations using Power BI to display sales trends, customer demographics, and product insights. Develop a comprehensive, interactive dashboard to present the analysis results clearly and intuitively. Enable stakeholders to filter and view data dynamically, enhancing their understanding and facilitating decision-making.
- Predictive Modeling: Build machine learning models to forecast future sales trends. Evaluate model performance and optimize through hyperparameter tuning.
- Actionable Business Insights: Generate insights that can inform data-driven business strategies.Make recommendations based on findings to improve operations and sales.
